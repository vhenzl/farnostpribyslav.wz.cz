# Homepage – Functional Specification

Chosen approach: a blend of A and B. It should not duplicate the “O webu” page.

## Composition

- Short intro (1–2 sentences) that sets context without repeating the About page.
- Primary links: Zprávy, Opravy varhan, O webu.
- Year overview: a compact list of years derived from Zprávy, each linking to the consolidated listing (anchors or top of year section).

## Notes

- Keep it concise and scannable; the full description belongs on O webu.
- No dynamic content at runtime; all derived at build time.
